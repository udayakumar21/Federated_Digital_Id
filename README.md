# Federated_Digital_Id
Introduction <br>
In India, there is no single universally accepted National ID system. Many Indian residents till date, have several forms of identity documents, for different purposes, such as EPIC for election purpose, a ration card for accessing the public distribution system, PAN card for tax registration, a driver’s license on road, and a passport for travelling abroad. These ID documents, in use, were basically derivatives of the services being offered by various agencies such as, EPIC, issued by the Election Commission of India. <br>
Objectives<br>
The objective of a federated digital identity is to allow individuals to use a single digital identity across multiple platforms and applications.
 Without the need for use of multiple ID’s or sharing personal information with each department. 
 This can be accomplished through the use of a central, secure identity provider[FDI] that is trusted by all of the platforms and applications that an individual uses. 
 This allows individuals to maintain control over their personal information and privacy, while still being able to access the services they need.
 Federated digital identity reduce overlaping of information and duplication of ID’s.<br>
