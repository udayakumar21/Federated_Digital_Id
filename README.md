# Federated_Digital_Id
# Federated Digital Identity (FDI) System

## 1. Introduction
In India, there is currently no universally accepted National ID system. This project aims to address that by providing a unique FDI ID to each individual that can be universally accepted. The objective is to streamline identification processes, reduce duplication of IDs, and enhance document security.

## 2. Objectives
- Provide a unique FDI ID to each individual that is universally accepted.
- Enable the use of FDI ID across multiple platforms and applications.
- Reduce information overlapping and duplication of IDs while ensuring document security.
- Allow users to access their personal information and original documents anytime and anywhere.
- Maintain control over personal information and privacy while accessing required services.

## 3. Functional Requirements
- Registration: Users can register by providing their basic details.
- Sign-up/Login: Users can log in once and access services without re-entering credentials.
- Upload Documents: Users can upload their original ID documents.
- Access Documents: Users can view their uploaded documents.
- Retrieve Documents: Clients can download the documents uploaded by users.
- Authentication: Users must authenticate to access the uploaded documents.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- Portability: The application is designed as a web portal.
- Reliability: The system behaves consistently in a user-friendly manner.
- Availability: The system is accessible at all times.
- Maintainability: Customer and order information is stored in a database.
- Security: Login authentication is required for website access.

## 5. Software Requirements
- Database: Firebase.
- Backend: Python, Flask framework.
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## 6. Hardware Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10 and above.
- RAM: 4 GB RAM or higher.

## 7. User Module
The user module includes basic user registration and login functionalities. Users can view their details on the dashboard and generate an ID based on mandatory documents. They can also log out of the application.

## 8. Client Module
The client module provides a user interface for agencies/organizations requesting the documents/IDs of individuals. Users can give consent to share specific documents, allowing the agency/organization to access them using the generated user ID for further processing.

## 9. Conclusion
The use of federated digital identity has the potential to improve the security, privacy, and interoperability of digital identity systems. The FDI application simplifies the authentication process, eliminating the need for users to remember multiple IDs for different platforms. This streamlines paperwork, saves time, and reduces energy consumption.
